# Windows Snipkit

Windows Snipkit is a collection of code snippets that provides working examples of techniques found in the Cyber Kill Chain.

I believe too many people rely too heavily on pre-built, automated tools and don't have a deep enough understanding of Windows security. This repository aims to provide open source examples of common Windows attacks for those who are interested in developing their skills as a Penetration Tester or Red Teamer.

This repository is for educational purposes only. I do not take responsibility for any damages caused by the code found in this repository.
